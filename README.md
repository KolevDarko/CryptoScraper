# Bitfinex Parser

![alt text](https://image.ibb.co/dOVUL7/index.png)

I was backtesting some trading strategy and needed hourly bitcoin data from 2013. 

There were modules to scrap from gdax but i couldn't find one to do so from Bitfinex

So i made this rough script quickly to grab data from bitfinex. It is not Object Orient and the code is very rough. But it works. It stores hourly OHLC data from bitfinex into a csv file. Data till March 2018 is already included

This is the first time i am sharing any script through github and the script is very rough. So forgive me if i didn't followed the standards and please let me know by forking the repo.
